# Big-Data-Customer-segmentation-and-churn-prediction-with-PySpark
Repository for utilizing PySpark for applying Big Data technologies
#Overview
This project shows how to use PySpark for large-scale data analysis and machine learning. It focuses on practical tasks like customer segmentation and predicting customer churn to provide useful insights.

#Data:
Online Retail (Chen, 2015) from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

#Approach

- RFM analysis
- Customer segmentation: K-means clustering
- Churn prediction: random forest and gradient-boosting trees
